# HardwarePrototyping
An introduction to hardware prototyping techniques for building solutions to problems in the physical world. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of prototyping tools like Arduinos and the steps required to turn a prototype into a manufacturable product. Other topics will include mechanical prototyping (3D printing, laser cutting), electronics design and CAD tools, and the business and economics of selling physical products. Students will use an Arduino to complete a single large project over the courseâ€™s four sessions.
